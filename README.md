Question:
What is this document about?

Answer:
It seems like you're looking for information on React JS, specifically about getting started and components. Let's dive into some of the key points from the sections you've mentioned:

### Chapter 1: Getting Started with React

#### What is ReactJS?
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application, which corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

#### Installation or Setup
To start using React, you can include it directly in your HTML pages via script tags or use a more complex setup like Create React App (CRA) for a complete development environment.
